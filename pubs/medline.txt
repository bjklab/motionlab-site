TI  - Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in primary human nasal
      cultures demonstrates Delta as most cytopathic and Omicron as fastest
      replicating.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was marked with emerging viral variants, some of
      which were designated as variants of concern (VOCs) due to selection and
      rapid circulation in the human population. Here we elucidate functional
      features of each VOC linked to variations in replication rate. Patient-
      derived primary nasal cultures grown at air-liquid-interface (ALI) were
      used to model upper-respiratory infection and human lung epithelial cell
      lines used to model lower-respiratory infection. All VOCs replicated to
      higher titers than the ancestral virus, suggesting a selection for
      replication efficiency. In primary nasal cultures, Omicron replicated to
      the highest titers at early time points, followed by Delta, paralleling
      comparative studies of population sampling. All SARS-CoV-2 viruses
      entered the cell primarily via a transmembrane serine protease 2
      (TMPRSS2)-dependent pathway, and Omicron was more likely to use an
      endosomal route of entry. All VOCs activated and overcame dsRNA-induced
      cellular responses including interferon (IFN) signaling, oligoadenylate
      ribonuclease L degradation and protein kinase R activation. Among the
      VOCs, Omicron infection induced expression of the most IFN and IFN
      stimulated genes. Infections in nasal cultures resulted in cellular
      damage, including a compromise of cell-barrier integrity and loss of
      nasal cilia and ciliary beating function, especially during Delta
      infection. Overall, Omicron was optimized for replication in the upper-
      respiratory system and least-favorable in the lower-respiratory cell
      line; and Delta was the most cytopathic for both upper and lower
      respiratory cells. Our findings highlight the functional differences
      among VOCs at the cellular level and imply distinct mechanisms of
      pathogenesis in infected individuals.

AB  - Respiratory microbial dysbiosis is associated with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in
      critically ill patients. However, we lack reproducible respiratory
      microbiome signatures that can increase our understanding of these
      conditions and potential treatments. Here, we analyze 16S rRNA sequencing
      data from 2,177 respiratory samples collected from 1,029 critically ill
      patients (21.7% with ARDS and 26.3% with HAP) and 327 healthy controls,
      sourced from 17 published studies. After data harmonization and pooling
      of individual patient data, we identified microbiota signatures
      associated with ARDS, HAP and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
      Microbiota signatures for HAP and prolonged mechanical ventilation were
      characterized by depletion of a core group of microbes typical of healthy
      respiratory samples, and the ARDS microbiota signature was distinguished
      by enrichment of potentially pathogenic respiratory microbes, including
      Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus. Using machine learning models, we
      identified clinically informative, three- and four-factor signatures that
      predicted ARDS, HAP and prolonged mechanical ventilation with relatively
      high accuracy (area under the curve of 0.751, 0.72 and 0.727,
      respectively). We validated the signatures in an independent prospective
      cohort of 136 patients on mechanical ventillation and found that patients
      with microbiome signatures associated with ARDS, HAP or prolonged
      mechanical ventilation had longer times to successful extubation than
      patients lacking these signatures (hazard ratios of 1.56 (95% confidence
      interval (CI) 1.07-2.27), 1.51 (95% CI 1.02-2.23) and 1.50 (95% CI
      1.03-2.18), respectively). Thus, we defined and validated robust
      respiratory microbiome signatures associated with ARDS and HAP that may
      help to identify promising targets for microbiome therapeutic modulation
      in critically ill patients.

TI  - Priorities and Progress in Gram-positive Bacterial Infection Research by
      the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group: A Narrative Review.
PG  - S295-S304
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciad565 [doi]
AB  - The Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG) has prioritized
      infections caused by gram-positive bacteria as one of its core areas of
      emphasis. The ARLG Gram-positive Committee has focused on studies
      responding to 3 main identified research priorities: (1) investigation of
      strategies or therapies for infections predominantly caused by gram-
      positive bacteria, (2) evaluation of the efficacy of novel agents for
      infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
      and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and (3) optimization of dosing and
      duration of antimicrobial agents for gram-positive infections. Herein, we
      summarize ARLG accomplishments in gram-positive bacterial infection
      research, including studies aiming to (1) inform optimal vancomycin
      dosing, (2) determine the role of dalbavancin in MRSA bloodstream
      infection, (3) characterize enterococcal bloodstream infections, (4)
      demonstrate the benefits of short-course therapy for pediatric community-
      acquired pneumonia, (5) develop quality of life measures for use in
      clinical trials, and (6) advance understanding of the microbiome. Future
      studies will incorporate innovative methodologies with a focus on
      interventional clinical trials that have the potential to change clinical
      practice for difficult-to-treat infections, such as MRSA bloodstream
      infections.

AB  - The spread of SARS-CoV-2, like that of many other pathogens, is governed
      by heterogeneity. "Superspreading," or "over-dispersion," is an important
      factor in transmission, yet it is hard to quantify. Estimates from
      contact tracing data are prone to potential biases due to the increased
      likelihood of detecting large clusters of cases, and may reflect
      variation in contact behavior more than biological heterogeneity. In
      contrast, the average number of secondary infections per contact is
      routinely estimated from household surveys, and these studies can
      minimize biases by testing all members of a household. However, the
      models used to analyze household transmission data typically assume that
      infectiousness and susceptibility are the same for all individuals or
      vary only with predetermined traits such as age. Here we develop and
      apply a combined forward simulation and inference method to quantify the
      degree of inter-individual variation in both infectiousness and
      susceptibility from observations of the distribution of infections in
      household surveys. First, analyzing simulated data, we show our method
      can reliably ascertain the presence, type, and amount of these
      heterogeneities given data from a sufficiently large sample of
      households. We then analyze a collection of household studies of COVID-19
      from diverse settings around the world, and find strong evidence for
      large heterogeneity in both the infectiousness and susceptibility of
      individuals. Our results also provide a framework to improve the design
      of studies to evaluate household interventions in the presence of
      realistic heterogeneity between individuals.

TI  - Infrequent intrahousehold transmission of Clostridioides difficile
      between pet owners and their pets.
PG  - 341-351
LID - 10.1111/zph.13032 [doi]
AB  - Companion animals have been shown to carry Clostridioides difficile
      strains that are similar or identical to strains found in people, and a
      small number of studies have shown that pets carry genetically identical
      C. difficile isolates as their owners, suggesting inter-species
      transmission. However, the directionality of transmission is ultimately
      unknown, and the frequency with which animals acquire C. difficile
      following their owners' infection is unclear. The goal of this study was
      to assess how often pets belonging to people with C. difficile infection
      carry genetically related C. difficile isolates. We enrolled pet owners
      from two medical institutions (University of Pennsylvania Health System
      (UPHS) and The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC)) who
      had diarrhoea with or without positive C. difficile assays and tested
      their faeces and their pets' faeces for C. difficile using both anaerobic
      culture and PCR assays. When microorganisms were obtained from both the
      owner and pet and had the same toxin profile or ribotype, isolates
      underwent genomic sequencing. Faecal samples were obtained from a total
      of 59 humans, 72 dogs and 9 cats, representing 47 complete households
      (i.e. where a sample was available from the owner and at least one pet).
      Of these, C. difficile was detected in 30 humans, 10 dogs and 0 cats.
      There were only two households where C. difficile was detected in both
      the owner and pet. In one of these households, the C. difficile isolates
      were of different toxin profiles/ribotypes (A+/B+ / RT 499 from the
      owner, A-/B- / RT PR22386 from the dog). In the other household, the
      isolates were genetically identical (one SNP difference). Interestingly,
      the dog from this household had recently received a course of antibiotics
      (cefpodoxime and metronidazole). Our findings suggest that inter-species
      transmission of C. difficile occurs infrequently in households with human
      C. difficile infections.

AB  - The spread of SARS-CoV-2, like that of many other pathogens, is governed
      by heterogeneity. "Superspreading," or "over-dispersion," is an important
      factor in transmission, yet it is hard to quantify. Estimates from
      contact tracing data are prone to potential biases due to the increased
      likelihood of detecting large clusters of cases, and may reflect
      variation in contact behavior more than biological heterogeneity. In
      contrast, the average number of secondary infections per contact is
      routinely estimated from household surveys, and these studies can
      minimize biases by testing all members of a household. However, the
      models used to analyze household transmission data typically assume that
      infectiousness and susceptibility are the same for all individuals or
      vary only with predetermined traits such as age. Here we develop and
      apply a combined forward simulation and inference method to quantify the
      degree of inter-individual variation in both infectiousness and
      susceptibility from observations of the distribution of infections in
      household surveys. First, analyzing simulated data, we show our method
      can reliably ascertain the presence, type, and amount of these
      heterogeneities with data from a sufficiently large sample of households.
      We then analyze a collection of household studies of COVID-19 from
      diverse settings around the world, and find strong evidence for large
      heterogeneity in both the infectiousness and susceptibility of
      individuals. Our results also provide a framework to improve the design
      of studies to evaluate household interventions in the presence of
      realistic heterogeneity between individuals.

      virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contamination of the healthcare environment.
PG  - 1773-1778
LID - 10.1017/ice.2021.530 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spatial and temporal extent of severe acute respiratory
      coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) environmental contamination has not been
      precisely defined. We sought to elucidate contamination of different
      surface types and how contamination changes over time. METHODS: We
      sampled surfaces longitudinally within COVID-19 patient rooms, performed
      quantitative RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and modeled
      distance, time, and severity of illness on the probability of detecting
      SARS-CoV-2 using a mixed-effects binomial model. RESULTS: The probability
      of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a patient room did not vary with distance.
      However, we found that surface type predicted probability of detection,
      with floors and high-touch surfaces having the highest probability of
      detection: floors (odds ratio [OR], 67.8; 95% credible interval [CrI],
      36.3-131) and high-touch elevated surfaces (OR, 7.39; 95% CrI,
      4.31-13.1). Increased surface contamination was observed in room where
      patients required high-flow oxygen, positive airway pressure, or
      mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.6; 95% CrI, 1.03-2.53). The probability of
      elevated surface contamination decayed with prolonged hospitalization,
      but the probability of floor detection increased with the duration of the
      local pandemic wave. CONCLUSIONS: Distance from a patient's bed did not
      predict SARS-CoV-2 RNA deposition in patient rooms, but surface type,
      severity of illness, and time from local pandemic wave predicted surface
      deposition.

TI  - Enterococci enhance Clostridioides difficile pathogenesis.
PG  - 780-786
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05438-x [doi]
AB  - Enteric pathogens are exposed to a dynamic polymicrobial environment in
      the gastrointestinal tract(1). This microbial community has been shown to
      be important during infection, but there are few examples illustrating
      how microbial interactions can influence the virulence of invading
      pathogens(2). Here we show that expansion of a group of antibiotic-
      resistant, opportunistic pathogens in the gut-the enterococci-enhances
      the fitness and pathogenesis of Clostridioides difficile. Through a
      parallel process of nutrient restriction and cross-feeding, enterococci
      shape the metabolic environment in the gut and reprogramme C. difficile
      metabolism. Enterococci provide fermentable amino acids, including
      leucine and ornithine, which increase C. difficile fitness in the
      antibiotic-perturbed gut. Parallel depletion of arginine by enterococci
      through arginine catabolism provides a metabolic cue for C. difficile
      that facilitates increased virulence. We find evidence of microbial
      interaction between these two pathogenic organisms in multiple mouse
      models of infection and patients infected with C. difficile. These
      findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of pathogenic
      microbiota in the susceptibility to and the severity of C. difficile
      infection.

TI  - Multiple Introductions of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta Variants into White-
      Tailed Deer in Pennsylvania.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began by viral spillover from animals to humans;
      today multiple animal species are known to be susceptible to infection.
      White-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, are infected in North America
      at substantial levels, and genomic data suggests that a variant in deer
      may have spilled back to humans. Here, we characterize SARS-CoV-2 in deer
      from Pennsylvania (PA) sampled during fall and winter 2021. Of 123 nasal
      swab samples analyzed by RT-qPCR, 20 (16.3%) were positive for SARS-
      CoV-2. Seven whole genome sequences were obtained, together with six more
      partial spike gene sequences. These annotated as alpha and delta
      variants, the first reported observations of these lineages in deer,
      documenting multiple new jumps from humans to deer. The alpha lineage
      persisted in deer after its displacement by delta in humans, and deer-
      derived alpha variants diverged significantly from those in humans,
      consistent with a distinctive evolutionary trajectory in deer. IMPORTANCE
      Coronaviruses have been documented to replicate in numerous species of
      vertebrates, and multiple spillovers of coronaviruses from animals into
      humans have founded human epidemics. The COVID-19 epidemic likely derived
      from a spillover of SARS-CoV-2 from bats into humans, possibly via an
      intermediate host. There are now several examples of SARS-CoV-2 jumping
      from humans into other mammals, including mink and deer, creating the
      potential for new animal reservoirs from which spillback into humans
      could occur. For this reason, data on formation of new animal reservoirs
      is of great importance for understanding possible sources of future
      infection. Here, we identify extensive infection in white-tailed deer in
      Pennsylvania, including what appear to be multiple independent
      transmissions. Data further suggests possible transmission among deer.
      These data thus help identify a potential new animal reservoir and
      provide background information relevant to its management.

TI  - Stopping Hospital Infections With Environmental Services (SHINE): A
      Cluster-randomized Trial of Intensive Monitoring Methods for Terminal
      Room Cleaning on Rates of Multidrug-resistant Organisms in the Intensive
      Care Unit.
PG  - 1217-1223
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac070 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) frequently contaminate
      hospital environments. We performed a multicenter, cluster-randomized,
      crossover trial of 2 methods for monitoring of terminal cleaning
      effectiveness. METHODS: Six intensive care units (ICUs) at 3 medical
      centers received both interventions sequentially, in randomized order.
      Ten surfaces were surveyed each in 5 rooms weekly, after terminal
      cleaning, with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) monitoring or an ultraviolet
      fluorescent marker (UV/F). Results were delivered to environmental
      services staff in real time with failing surfaces recleaned. We measured
      monthly rates of MDRO infection or colonization, including methicillin-
      resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridioides difficile, vancomycin-
      resistant Enterococcus, and MDR gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) during a
      12-month baseline period and sequential 6-month intervention periods,
      separated by a 2-month washout. Primary analysis compared only the
      randomized intervention periods, whereas secondary analysis included the
      baseline. RESULTS: The ATP method was associated with a reduction in
      incidence rate of MDRO infection or colonization compared with the UV/F
      period (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.876; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.807-0.951; P = .002). Including the baseline period, the ATP method was
      associated with reduced infection with MDROs (IRR 0.924; 95% CI,
      0.855-0.998; P = .04), and MDR-GNB infection or colonization (IRR 0.856;
      95% CI, 0.825-0.887; P < .001). The UV/F intervention was not associated
      with a statistically significant impact on these outcomes. Room
      turnaround time increased by a median of 1 minute with the ATP
      intervention and 4.5 minutes with UV/F compared with baseline.
      CONCLUSIONS: Intensive monitoring of ICU terminal room cleaning with an
      ATP modality is associated with a reduction of MDRO infection and
      colonization.

LID - 10.1017/ice.2021.323 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) colonizing the
      healthcare environment have been shown to contribute to risk for
      healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), with adverse effects on patient
      morbidity and mortality. We sought to determine how bacterial
      contamination and persistent MDRO colonization of the healthcare
      environment are related to the position of patients and wastewater sites.
      METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study, enrolling 51 hospital
      rooms at the time of admitting a patient with an eligible MDRO in the
      prior 30 days. We performed systematic sampling and MDRO culture of
      rooms, as well as 16S rRNA sequencing to define the environmental
      microbiome in a subset of samples. RESULTS: The probability of detecting
      resistant gram-negative organisms, including Enterobacterales,
      Acinetobacter spp, and Pseudomonas spp, increased with distance from the
      patient. In contrast, Clostridioides difficile and methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus were more likely to be detected close to the
      patient. Resistant Pseudomonas spp and S. aureus were enriched in these
      hot spots despite broad deposition of 16S rRNA gene sequences assigned to
      the same genera, suggesting modifiable factors that permit the
      persistence of these MDROs. CONCLUSIONS: MDRO hot spots can be defined by
      distance from the patient and from wastewater reservoirs. Evaluating how
      MDROs are enriched relative to bacterial DNA deposition helps to identify
      healthcare micro-environments and suggests how targeted environmental
      cleaning or design approaches could prevent MDRO persistence and reduce
      infection risk.

AB  - Mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 can affect the performance of
      molecular diagnostic assays. In some cases, such as S-gene target
      failure, the impact can serve as a unique indicator of a particular SARS-
      CoV-2 variant and provide a method for rapid detection. Here, we describe
      partial ORF1ab gene target failure (pOGTF) on the cobas SARS-CoV-2
      assays, defined by a >/=2-thermocycle delay in detection of the ORF1ab
      gene compared to that of the E-gene. We demonstrate that pOGTF is 98.6%
      sensitive and 99.9% specific for SARS-CoV-2 lineage BA.2.12.1, an
      emerging variant in the United States with spike L452Q and S704L
      mutations that may affect transmission, infectivity, and/or immune
      evasion. Increasing rates of pOGTF closely mirrored rates of BA.2.12.1
      sequences uploaded to public databases, and, importantly, increasing
      local rates of pOGTF also mirrored increasing overall test positivity.
      Use of pOGTF as a proxy for BA.2.12.1 provides faster tracking of the
      variant than whole-genome sequencing and can benefit laboratories without
      sequencing capabilities.

TI  - Respiratory Microbiome Disruption and Risk for Ventilator-Associated
      Lower Respiratory Tract Infection.
PG  - 1564-1571
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciab678 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infection (VA-
      LRTI) is common among critically ill patients and has been associated
      with increased morbidity and mortality. In acute critical illness,
      respiratory microbiome disruption indices (MDIs) have been shown to
      predict risk for VA-LRTI, but their utility beyond the first days of
      critical illness is unknown. We sought to characterize how MDIs
      previously shown to predict VA-LRTI at initiation of mechanical
      ventilation change with prolonged mechanical ventilation, and if they
      remain associated with VA-LRTI risk. METHODS: We developed a cohort of 83
      subjects admitted to a long-term acute care hospital due to their
      prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation; performed dense,
      longitudinal sampling of the lower respiratory tract, collecting 1066
      specimens; and characterized the lower respiratory microbiome by 16S rRNA
      sequencing as well as total bacterial abundance by 16S rRNA quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Cross-sectional MDIs, including low
      Shannon diversity and high total bacterial abundance, were associated
      with risk for VA-LRTI, but associations had wide posterior credible
      intervals. Persistent lower respiratory microbiome disruption showed a
      more robust association with VA-LRTI risk, with each day of (base e)
      Shannon diversity <2.0 associated with a VA-LRTI odds ratio of 1.36 (95%
      credible interval, 1.10-1.72). The observed association was consistent
      across multiple clinical definitions of VA-LRTI. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-
      sectional MDIs have limited ability to discriminate VA-LRTI risk during
      prolonged mechanical ventilation, but persistent lower respiratory tract
      microbiome disruption, best characterized by consecutive days with low
      Shannon diversity, may identify a population at high risk for infection
      and may help target infection-prevention interventions.

AB  - We evaluated the effect of terminal cleaning on SARS-CoV-2 RNA
      contamination of COVID-19 isolation rooms in an acute care hospital.
      SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 32.1% of room surfaces after cleaning; the
      odds of contamination increased with month. The prevalence of elevated
      high-touch surface contamination was lower in terminally cleaned rooms
      than patient-occupied rooms.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (AY.3) in the Feces of a Domestic Cat.
LID - 421 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14020421 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections
      have spilled over from humans to companion and wild animals since the
      inception of the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, whole genome
      sequencing data of the viral genomes that infect non-human animal species
      have been scant. Here, we detected and sequenced a SARS-CoV-2 delta
      variant (AY.3) in fecal samples from an 11-year-old domestic house cat
      previously exposed to an owner who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
      Molecular testing of two fecal samples collected 7 days apart yielded
      relatively high levels of viral RNA. Sequencing of the feline-derived
      viral genomes showed the two to be identical, and differing by between 4
      and 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms in pairwise comparisons to human-
      derived lineage AY.3 sequences collected in the same geographic area and
      time period. However, several mutations unique to the feline samples
      reveal their divergence from this cohort on phylogenetic analysis. These
      results demonstrate continued spillover infections of emerging SARS-CoV-2
      variants that threaten human and animal health, as well as highlight the
      importance of collecting fecal samples when testing for SARS-CoV-2 in
      animals. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first published case of a
      SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in a domestic cat in the United States.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Variants Associated with Vaccine Breakthrough in the Delaware
      Valley through Summer 2021.
PG  - e0378821
LID - 10.1128/mbio.03788-21 [doi]
AB  - The severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of
      the global outbreak of COVID-19. Evidence suggests that the virus is
      evolving to allow efficient spread through the human population,
      including vaccinated individuals. Here, we report a study of viral
      variants from surveillance of the Delaware Valley, including the city of
      Philadelphia, and variants infecting vaccinated subjects. We sequenced
      and analyzed complete viral genomes from 2621 surveillance samples from
      March 2020 to September 2021 and compared them to genome sequences from
      159 vaccine breakthroughs. In the early spring of 2020, all detected
      variants were of the B.1 and closely related lineages. A mixture of
      lineages followed, notably including B.1.243 followed by B.1.1.7 (alpha),
      with other lineages present at lower levels. Later isolations were
      dominated by B.1.617.2 (delta) and other delta lineages; delta was the
      exclusive variant present by the last time sampled. To investigate
      whether any variants appeared preferentially in vaccine breakthroughs, we
      devised a model based on Bayesian autoregressive moving average logistic
      multinomial regression to allow rigorous comparison. This revealed that
      B.1.617.2 (delta) showed 3-fold enrichment in vaccine breakthrough cases
      (odds ratio of 3; 95% credible interval 0.89-11). Viral point
      substitutions could also be associated with vaccine breakthroughs,
      notably the N501Y substitution found in the alpha, beta and gamma
      variants (odds ratio 2.04; 95% credible interval of1.25-3.18). This study
      thus overviews viral evolution and vaccine breakthroughs in the Delaware
      Valley and introduces a rigorous statistical approach to interrogating
      enrichment of breakthrough variants against a changing background.
      IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is highly effective at reducing viral
      infection, hospitalization and death. However, vaccine breakthrough
      infections have been widely observed, raising the question of whether
      particular viral variants or viral mutations are associated with
      breakthrough. Here, we report analysis of 2621 surveillance isolates from
      people diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Delaware Valley in southeastern
      Pennsylvania, allowing rigorous comparison to 159 vaccine breakthrough
      case specimens. Our best estimate is a 3-fold enrichment for some
      lineages of delta among breakthroughs, and enrichment of a notable spike
      substitution, N501Y. We introduce statistical methods that should be
      widely useful for evaluating vaccine breakthroughs and other viral
      phenotypes.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections
      have spilled over from humans to companion and wild animals since the
      inception of the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, whole genome
      sequencing data of the viral genomes that infect non-human animal species
      has been scant. Here, we detected and sequenced a SARS-CoV-2 delta
      variant (AY.3) in fecal samples from an 11-year-old domestic house cat
      previously exposed to an owner who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
      Molecular testing of two fecal samples collected 7 days apart yielded
      relatively high levels of viral RNA. Sequencing of the feline-derived
      viral genomes showed the two to be identical, and differing by between 4
      and 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms in pairwise comparisons to human-
      derived lineage AY.3 sequences collected in the same geographic area and
      time period. However, several mutations unique to the feline samples
      reveal their divergence from this cohort on phylogenetic analysis. These
      results demonstrate continued spillover infections of emerging SARS-CoV-2
      variants that threaten human and animal health, as well as highlight the
      importance of collecting fecal samples when testing for SARS-CoV-2 in
      animals. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first published case of a
      SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in a domestic cat in the United States.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of
      the global outbreak of COVID-19. Evidence suggests that the virus is
      evolving to allow efficient spread through the human population,
      including vaccinated individuals. Here we report a study of viral
      variants from surveillance of the Delaware Valley, including the city of
      Philadelphia, and variants infecting vaccinated subjects. We sequenced
      and analyzed complete viral genomes from 2621 surveillance samples from
      March 2020 to September 2021 and compared them to genome sequences from
      159 vaccine breakthroughs. In the early spring of 2020, all detected
      variants were of the B.1 and closely related lineages. A mixture of
      lineages followed, notably including B.1.243 followed by B.1.1.7 (alpha),
      with other lineages present at lower levels. Later isolations were
      dominated by B.1.617.2 (delta) and other delta lineages; delta was the
      exclusive variant present by the last time sampled. To investigate
      whether any variants appeared preferentially in vaccine breakthroughs, we
      devised a model based on Bayesian autoregressive moving average logistic
      multinomial regression to allow rigorous comparison. This revealed that
      B.1.617.2 (delta) showed three-fold enrichment in vaccine breakthrough
      cases (odds ratio of 3; 95% credible interval 0.89-11). Viral point
      substitutions could also be associated with vaccine breakthroughs,
      notably the N501Y substitution found in the alpha, beta and gamma
      variants (odds ratio 2.04; 95% credible interval of 1.25-3.18). This
      study thus provides a detailed picture of viral evolution in the Delaware
      Valley and a geographically matched analysis of vaccine breakthroughs; it
      also introduces a rigorous statistical approach to interrogating
      enrichment of viral variants.

TI  - Dynamic Changes in the Nasal Microbiome Associated With Disease Activity
      in Patients With Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis.
PG  - 1703-1712
LID - 10.1002/art.41723 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about temporal changes in nasal bacteria in
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). This study was undertaken to
      examine longitudinal changes in the nasal microbiome in association with
      relapse in GPA patients. METHODS: Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene
      sequencing was performed on nasal swabs from 19 patients with GPA who
      were followed up longitudinally for a total of 78 visits, including 9
      patients who experienced a relapse and 10 patients who remained in
      remission. Relative abundance of bacteria and ratios between bacteria
      were examined. Generalized estimating equation models were used to
      evaluate the association between bacterial composition and 1) disease
      activity and 2) levels of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) with
      specificity for proteinase 3 (PR3), adjusted for medication. RESULTS:
      Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus were the most abundant bacterial
      genera across all nasal samples. Patients with quiescent disease
      maintained a stable ratio of Corynebacterium to Staphylococcus across
      visits. In contrast, in patients who experienced a relapse, a
      significantly lower ratio was observed at the visit prior to relapse,
      followed by a higher ratio at the time of relapse (adjusted P < 0.01).
      Species-level analysis identified an association between a higher
      abundance of nasal Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and 1) relapse
      (adjusted P = 0.04) and 2) higher PR3-ANCA levels (adjusted P = 0.02).
      CONCLUSION: In GPA, significant changes occur in the nasal microbiome
      over time and are associated with disease activity. The occurrence of
      these changes months prior to the onset of relapse supports a pathogenic
      role of nasal bacteria in GPA. Our results uphold existing hypotheses
      implicating Staphylococcus as an instigator of disease and have generated
      a novel finding involving Corynebacterium as a potential mediator of
      disease in GPA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation provide
      essential support for patients with respiratory failure, but the course
      of mechanical ventilation may be complicated by adverse ventilator-
      associated events (VAEs), which may or may not be associated with
      infection. We sought to understand how the frequency of subglottic
      suction, an indicator of the quantity of sputum produced by ventilated
      patients, relates to the onset of all VAEs and infection-associated VAEs.
      DESIGN: We performed a case-crossover study including 87 patients with
      VAEs, and we evaluated 848 days in the pre-VAE period at risk for a VAE.
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Critically ill patients were recruited from the
      medical intensive care unit of an academic medical center. METHODS: We
      used the number of as-needed subglottic suctioning events performed per
      calendar day to quantify sputum production, and we compared the immediate
      pre-VAE period to the preceding period. We used CDC surveillance
      definitions for VAE and to categorize whether events were infection
      associated or not. RESULTS: Sputum quantity measured by subglottic
      suction frequency is greater in the period immediately prior to VAE than
      in the preceding period. However, it does not discriminate well between
      infection-associated VAEs and VAEs without associated infection.
      CONCLUSIONS: Subglottic suction frequency may serve as a valuable marker
      of sputum quantity, and it is associated with risk of a VAE. However, our
      results require validation in a broader population of mechanically
      ventilated patients and intensive care settings.

TI  - Quantifying the Impact of Nasopharyngeal Specimen Quality on Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Test Performance.
PG  - ofab235
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofab235 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
      CoV-2) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle
      threshold (Ct) has been used to estimate quantitative viral load, with
      the goal of targeting isolation precautions for individuals with
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and guiding public health
      interventions. However, variability in specimen quality can alter the Ct
      values obtained from SARS-CoV-2 clinical assays. We sought to define how
      variable nasopharyngeal (NP) swab quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2
      test sensitivity. METHODS: We performed amplification of a human gene
      target (beta-actin) in parallel with a clinical RT-PCR targeting the
      SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1282 NP specimens collected from patients with
      clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the relationship between NP
      specimen quality, characterized by late Ct values for the human gene
      target beta-actin Ct, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via
      logistic regression, as well as the linear relationship between SARS-
      CoV-2 and beta-actin Ct. RESULTS: Low-quality NP swabs are less likely to
      detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio, 0.607 [95% credible interval {CrI},
      .487-.753]). We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-
      CoV-2 and beta-actin Ct values (slope, 0.181 [95% CrI, .097-.264]),
      consistent with a reduction in detection of 0.181 cycles for each
      additional cycle of the beta-actin target. COVID-19 disease severity was
      not associated with beta-actin Ct values. CONCLUSIONS: Variability in NP
      specimen quality significantly impacts the performance of clinical SARS-
      CoV-2 assays, and caution should be taken when interpreting quantitative
      SARS-CoV-2 Ct results. If unrecognized, low-quality NP specimens, which
      are characterized by a low level of amplifiable human DNA target, may
      limit the successful application of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values to direct
      infection control and public health interventions.

TI  - Pet Ownership Protects Against Recurrence of Clostridioides difficile
      Infection.
PG  - ofz541
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofz541 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause
      of antibiotic-associated and health care-associated diarrhea in humans.
      Recurrent CDI (R-CDI) occurs in ~20%-30% of patients with CDI and results
      in increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs. Genomic analyses
      have shown overlap of C. difficile isolates from animals and people,
      suggesting that a zoonotic reservoir may contribute to recurrence. The
      objective of this study was to determine whether pet ownership is a risk
      factor for recurrence of CDI. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study
      among patients with recurrent CDI (cases; n = 86) and patients with
      nonrecurrent CDI (controls; n = 146). Multivariable logistic regression
      modeling was used to determine the association between recurrence of CDI
      and pet ownership while accounting for patient-level risk factors.
      RESULTS: Pet ownership was not significantly associated with recurrence
      of CDI (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-2.72; P
      = 0.965) among all patients (n = 232). However, among the subset of
      patients with community-associated or community-onset health care
      facility-acquired CDI (n = 127), increasing contact with pets was
      increasingly protective against recurrence: for every point increase in a
      pet contact score (out of 7 possible points), the odds of recurrence
      decreased by 14% (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-1.00; P = 0.051). CONCLUSIONS:
      Close interactions with pets appear protective against the recurrence of
      community-acquired CDI. A potential mechanism may involve beneficial
      contributions to the microbiota of pet owners afflicted with CDI, as has
      been observed for other conditions such as atopy, obesity, and food
      allergies. However, more research is needed to understand the
      interactions between pets, owners, and their microbiota.

TI  - Gut microbiota features associated with Clostridioides difficile
      colonization in puppies.
PG  - e0215497
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0215497 [doi]
AB  - In people, colonization with Clostridioides difficile, the leading cause
      of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, has been shown to be associated with
      distinct gut microbial features, including reduced bacterial community
      diversity and depletion of key taxa. In dogs, the gut microbiota features
      that define C. difficile colonization are less well understood. We sought
      to define the gut microbiota features associated with C. difficile
      colonization in puppies, a population where the prevalence of C.
      difficile has been shown to be elevated, and to define the effect of
      puppy age and litter upon these features and C. difficile risk. We
      collected fecal samples from weaned (n = 27) and unweaned (n = 74)
      puppies from 13 litters and analyzed the effects of colonization status,
      age and litter on microbial diversity using linear mixed effects models.
      Colonization with C. difficile was significantly associated with younger
      age, and colonized puppies had significantly decreased bacterial
      community diversity and differentially abundant taxa compared to non-
      colonized puppies, even when adjusting for age. C. difficile colonization
      remained associated with decreased bacterial community diversity, but the
      association did not reach statistical significance in a mixed effects
      model incorporating litter as a random effect. Even though litter
      explained a greater proportion (67%) of the variability in microbial
      diversity than colonization status, we nevertheless observed
      heterogeneity in gut microbial community diversity and colonization
      status within more than half of the litters, suggesting that the gut
      microbiota contributes to colonization resistance against C. difficile.
      The colonization of puppies with C. difficile has important implications
      for the potential zoonotic transfer of this organism to people. The
      identified associations point to mechanisms by which C. difficile
      colonization may be reduced.

TI  - Impact of Levofloxacin for the Prophylaxis of Bloodstream Infection on
      the Gut Microbiome in Patients With Hematologic Malignancy.
PG  - ofz252
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofz252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the differential impact of levofloxacin
      administered for the prophylaxis of bloodstream infections compared with
      broad-spectrum beta-lactam (BSBL) antibiotics used for the treatment of
      neutropenic fever on the gut microbiome in patients with hematologic
      malignancy. METHODS: Stool specimens were collected from patients
      admitted for chemotherapy or stem cell transplant in the setting of the
      evaluation of diarrhea from February 2017 until November 2017. Microbiome
      characteristics were compared among those exposed to levofloxacin
      prophylaxis vs those who received BSBL antibiotics. RESULTS: Sixty
      patients were included, most with acute myeloid leukemia (42%) or
      multiple myeloma (37%). The gut microbiome of patients with BSBL exposure
      had significantly reduced Shannon's alpha diversity compared with those
      without (median [interquartile range {IQR}], 3.28 [1.73 to 3.71] vs 3.73
      [3.14 to 4.31]; P = .01). However, those with levofloxacin exposure had
      increased alpha diversity compared with those without (median [IQR], 3.83
      [3.32 to 4.36] vs 3.32 [2.35 to 4.02]; P = .03). Levofloxacin exposure
      was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of dominance of non-
      Bacteroidetes genera compared with those without levofloxacin exposure (3
      [14%] vs 15 [38%]; P = .051). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of antibiotics on
      the gut microbiome varies by class, and levofloxacin may disrupt the gut
      microbiome less than BSBLs in this patient population.

TI  - Molecular analysis of bacterial contamination on stethoscopes in an
      intensive care unit.
PG  - 171-177
LID - 10.1017/ice.2018.319 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Culture-based studies, which focus on individual organisms,
      have implicated stethoscopes as potential vectors of nosocomial bacterial
      transmission. However, the full bacterial communities that contaminate
      in-use stethoscopes have not been investigated. METHODS: We used
      bacterial 16S rRNA gene deep-sequencing, analysis, and quantification to
      profile entire bacterial populations on stethoscopes in use in an
      intensive care unit (ICU), including practitioner stethoscopes,
      individual-use patient-room stethoscopes, and clean unused individual-use
      stethoscopes. Two additional sets of practitioner stethoscopes were
      sampled before and after cleaning using standardized or practitioner-
      preferred methods. RESULTS: Bacterial contamination levels were highest
      on practitioner stethoscopes, followed by patient-room stethoscopes,
      whereas clean stethoscopes were indistinguishable from background
      controls. Bacterial communities on stethoscopes were complex, and
      community analysis by weighted UniFrac showed that physician and patient-
      room stethoscopes were indistinguishable and significantly different from
      clean stethoscopes and background controls. Genera relevant to
      healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were common on practitioner
      stethoscopes, among which Staphylococcus was ubiquitous and had the
      highest relative abundance (6.8%-14% of contaminating bacterial
      sequences). Other HAI-related genera were also widespread although lower
      in abundance. Cleaning of practitioner stethoscopes resulted in a
      significant reduction in bacterial contamination levels, but these levels
      reached those of clean stethoscopes in only a few cases with either
      standardized or practitioner-preferred methods, and bacterial community
      composition did not significantly change. CONCLUSIONS: Stethoscopes used
      in an ICU carry bacterial DNA reflecting complex microbial communities
      that include nosocomially important taxa. Commonly used cleaning
      practices reduce contamination but are only partially successful at
      modifying or eliminating these communities.

TI  - Combined Biomarkers Predict Acute Mortality Among Critically Ill Patients
      With Suspected Sepsis.
PG  - 1106-1113
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000003137 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is associated with high early and total in-hospital
      mortality. Despite recent revisions in the diagnostic criteria for sepsis
      that sought to improve predictive validity for mortality, it remains
      difficult to identify patients at greatest risk of death. We compared the
      utility of nine biomarkers to predict mortality in subjects with
      clinically suspected bacterial sepsis. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The
      medical and surgical ICUs at an academic medical center. SUBJECTS: We
      enrolled 139 subjects who met two or more systemic inflammatory response
      syndrome (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) criteria and received
      new broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. INTERVENTIONS: We assayed nine
      biomarkers (alpha-2 macroglobulin, C-reactive protein, ferritin,
      fibrinogen, haptoglobin, procalcitonin, serum amyloid A, serum amyloid P,
      and tissue plasminogen activator) at onset of suspected sepsis and 24,
      48, and 72 hours thereafter. We compared biomarkers between groups based
      on both 14-day and total in-hospital mortality and evaluated the
      predictive validity of single and paired biomarkers via area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
      Fourteen-day mortality was 12.9%, and total in-hospital mortality was
      29.5%. Serum amyloid P was significantly lower (4/4 timepoints) and
      tissue plasminogen activator significantly higher (3/4 timepoints) in the
      14-day mortality group, and the same pattern held for total in-hospital
      mortality (Wilcoxon p </= 0.046 for all timepoints). Serum amyloid P and
      tissue plasminogen activator demonstrated the best individual predictive
      performance for mortality, and combinations of biomarkers including serum
      amyloid P and tissue plasminogen activator achieved greater predictive
      performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve >
      0.76 for 14-d and 0.74 for total mortality). CONCLUSIONS: Combined
      biomarkers predict risk for 14-day and total mortality among subjects
      with suspected sepsis. Serum amyloid P and tissue plasminogen activator
      demonstrated the best discriminatory ability in this cohort.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) carry significant
      economic burden, as well as morbidity and mortality, especially when
      caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Several new
      MRSA-active antibiotics have been developed, including semisynthetic
      glycopeptides (telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin). Of these,
      dalbavancin and oritavancin offer extended dosing intervals. METHODS: We
      performed a systematic review, network meta-analysis and cost analysis to
      compare the newer glycopeptides to standard care and to each other for
      the treatment of complicated SSTIs (cSSTI). A search for randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted in Medline, Embase and the
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We also developed a model
      to evaluate the costs associated with dalbavancin and oritavancin from
      the third-party payer perspective. RESULTS: Seven RCTs met the inclusion
      criteria. Network meta-analyses suggested that the clinical response to
      telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin was similar to standard care
      (odds ratio (OR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-1.33; OR 0.78,
      95% CI 0.52-1.18; and OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85-1.33, respectively). Head-to-
      head comparisons showed no difference in clinical response between
      oritavancin and dalbavancin (OR 1.36; 95% CI 0.85-2.18), oritavancin and
      telavancin (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.72-1.31) or dalbavancin and telavancin (OR
      0.72; 95% CI 0.45-1.13). Telavancin had a higher incidence of overall
      adverse events compared to standard care (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.10-1.61).
      Compared to telavancin, there were fewer overall adverse events with
      dalbavancin (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.45-0.76) and oritavancin (OR 0.71; 95% CI
      0.55-0.92). Studies were of high quality overall. Our cost analyses
      demonstrated that dalbavancin and oritavancin were less costly compared
      to standard care under baseline assumptions and many scenarios evaluated.
      The use of dalbavancin could save third-party payers $1442 to $4803 per
      cSSTI, while the use of oritavancin could save $3571 to $6932 per cSSTI.
      CONCLUSIONS: Dalbavancin and oritavancin demonstrate efficacy and safety
      comparable to standard care in well-designed RCTs and result in cost
      savings when standard care is treatment that covers MRSA.

AB  - A substantial proportion of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) cases
      recur after completion of antibiotic therapy, and antibiotic cure rates
      diminish with each recurrence of CDI. Fecal microbiota transplantation
      (FMT) is an effective therapy for recurrent FMT, which otherwise requires
      prolonged or indefinite antibiotic treatment. FMT is performed by
      introducing the fecal microbial community obtained from a healthy donor
      or pool of donors into the stomach, small intestine, or colon of a
      patient with CDI. Multiple clinical trials support the usefulness of FMT
      in treating recurrent CDI, and CDI treatment guidelines now include
      consideration of FMT at the third CDI recurrence. However, there remain
      challenges to incorporating FMT into clinical practice. First, methods of
      fecal bacterial community processing vary, as do methods of FMT
      administration. Second, the optimal dosing strategy and expected benefit
      of FMT for refractory CDI, particularly for severe and severe complicated
      cases, are uncertain. Third, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      considers FMT an investigational treatment. Fourth, insurance
      reimbursement for FMT usually falls short of FMT administration costs. In
      the setting of rising C difficile incidence and growing evidence for FMT
      efficacy, the demand for FMT has increased. However, uncertainty
      surrounding optimal FMT preparation and administration methods, FDA
      oversight, and insurance reimbursement presently limits the clinical
      practice of FMT.

AB  - Among surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients, it is difficult to
      distinguish bacterial sepsis from other causes of systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome (SIRS). Biomarkers have proven useful to identify the
      presence of bacterial infection. We enrolled a prospective cohort of 69
      SICU patients with suspected sepsis and assayed the concentrations of 9
      biomarkers (alpha-2 macroglobulin [A2M], C-reactive protein, ferritin,
      fibrinogen, haptoglobin, procalcitonin [PCT], serum amyloid A, serum
      amyloid P, and tissue plasminogen activator) at baseline, 24, 48, and
      72hours. Forty-two patients (61%) had bacterial sepsis by chart review.
      A2M concentrations were significantly lower, and PCT concentrations were
      significantly higher in subjects with bacterial sepsis at 3 of 4 time
      points. Using optimal cutoff values, the combination of baseline A2M and
      72-hour PCT achieved a negative predictive value of 75% (95% confidence
      interval, 54-96%). The combination of A2M and PCT discriminated bacterial
      sepsis from other SIRS among SICU patients with suspected sepsis.

TI  - Composition and dynamics of the respiratory tract microbiome in intubated
      patients.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s40168-016-0151-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major
      contributor to respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical
      ventilation. LRTI also occurs during mechanical ventilation, increasing
      the morbidity and mortality of intubated patients. We sought to
      understand the dynamics of respiratory tract microbiota following
      intubation and the relationship between microbial community structure and
      infection. RESULTS: We enrolled a cohort of 15 subjects with respiratory
      failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation from the medical
      intensive care unit at an academic medical center. Oropharyngeal (OP) and
      deep endotracheal (ET) secretions were sampled within 24 h of intubation
      and every 48-72 h thereafter. Bacterial community profiling was carried
      out by purifying DNA, PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene
      sequences, deep sequencing, and bioinformatic community analysis. We
      compared enrolled subjects to a cohort of healthy subjects who had lower
      respiratory tract sampling by bronchoscopy. In contrast to the diverse
      upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract microbiota found in
      healthy controls, critically ill subjects had lower initial diversity at
      both sites. Diversity further diminished over time on the ventilator. In
      several subjects, the bacterial community was dominated by a single taxon
      over multiple time points. The clinical diagnosis of LRTI ascertained by
      chart review correlated with low community diversity and dominance of a
      single taxon. Dominant taxa matched clinical bacterial cultures where
      cultures were obtained and positive. In several cases, dominant taxa
      included bacteria not detected by culture, including Ureaplasma parvum
      and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analysis of
      respiratory tract microbiota in critically ill patients provides insight

LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv183 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: The variation in community composition between microbiome
      samples, termed beta diversity, can be measured by pairwise distance
      based on either presence-absence or quantitative species abundance data.
      PERMANOVA, a permutation-based extension of multivariate analysis of
      variance to a matrix of pairwise distances, partitions within-group and
      between-group distances to permit assessment of the effect of an exposure
      or intervention (grouping factor) upon the sampled microbiome. Within-
      group distance and exposure/intervention effect size must be accurately
      modeled to estimate statistical power for a microbiome study that will be
      analyzed with pairwise distances and PERMANOVA. RESULTS: We present a
      framework for PERMANOVA power estimation tailored to marker-gene
      microbiome studies that will be analyzed by pairwise distances, which
      includes: (i) a novel method for distance matrix simulation that permits
      modeling of within-group pairwise distances according to pre-specified
      population parameters; (ii) a method to incorporate effects of different
      sizes within the simulated distance matrix; (iii) a simulation-based
      method for estimating PERMANOVA power from simulated distance matrices;
      and (iv) an R statistical software package that implements the above.
      Matrices of pairwise distances can be efficiently simulated to satisfy
      the triangle inequality and incorporate group-level effects, which are
      quantified by the adjusted coefficient of determination, omega-squared
      (omega2). From simulated distance matrices, available PERMANOVA power or
      necessary sample size can be estimated for a planned microbiome study.

TI  - Quantitation of HIV DNA integration: effects of differential integration
      site distributions on Alu-PCR assays.
PG  - 53-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.01.004 [doi]
LID - S0166-0934(13)00009-8 [pii]
AB  - In many studies of HIV replication, it is useful to quantify the number
      of HIV proviruses in cells against a background of unintegrated forms of
      the HIV DNA. A popular method for doing so involves quantitative PCR
      using one primer complementary to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR), and
      a second primer complementary to a cellular Alu repeat, so that PCR
      product only forms from templates where a provirus is integrated in the
      human genome near an Alu repeat. However, several recent studies have
      identified conditions that alter distributions of HIV integration sites
      relative to genes. Because Alu repeats are enriched in gene rich regions,
      this raises the question of whether altered integration site
      distributions might confound provirus abundance measurements using the
      Alu-PCR method. Here modified versions of the HIV tethering protein
      LEDGF/p75 were used to retarget HIV integration outside of transcription
      units, and show that this has a negligible effect on Alu-PCR quantitation
      of proviral abundance. Thus altered integration targeting, at least to
      the degree achieved here, is not a major concern when using the Alu-PCR
      assay.

TI  - Signs of the 2009 influenza pandemic in the New York-Presbyterian
      Hospital electronic health records.
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0012658 [doi]
LID - e12658 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In June of 2009, the World Health Organization declared the
      first influenza pandemic of the 21(st) century, and by July, New York
      City's New York-Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) experienced a heavy burden
      of cases, attributable to a novel strain of the virus (H1N1pdm). METHODS
      AND RESULTS: We present the signs in the NYPH electronic health records
      (EHR) that distinguished the 2009 pandemic from previous seasonal
      influenza outbreaks via various statistical analyses. These signs include
      (1) an increase in the number of patients diagnosed with influenza, (2) a
      preponderance of influenza diagnoses outside of the normal flu season,
      and (3) marked vaccine failure. The NYPH EHR also reveals distinct age
      distributions of patients affected by seasonal influenza and the pandemic
      strain, and via available longitudinal data, suggests that the two may be
      associated with distinct sets of comorbid conditions as well. In
      particular, we find significantly more pandemic flu patients with
      diagnoses associated with asthma and underlying lung disease. We further
      observe that the NYPH EHR is capable of tracking diseases at a resolution
      as high as particular zip codes in New York City. CONCLUSION: The NYPH
      EHR permits early detection of pandemic influenza and hypothesis
      generation via identification of those significantly associated
      illnesses. As data standards develop and databases expand, EHRs will
      contribute more and more to disease detection and the discovery of novel
      disease associations.

TI  - The fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme FabI plays a key role in the
      development of liver-stage malarial parasites.
PG  - 567-78
LID - 10.1016/j.chom.2008.11.001 [doi]
AB  - The fatty acid synthesis type II pathway has received considerable
      interest as a candidate therapeutic target in Plasmodium falciparum
      asexual blood-stage infections. This apicoplast-resident pathway,
      distinct from the mammalian type I process, includes FabI. Here, we
      report synthetic chemistry and transfection studies concluding that
      Plasmodium FabI is not the target of the antimalarial activity of
      triclosan, an inhibitor of bacterial FabI. Disruption of fabI in P.
      falciparum or the rodent parasite P. berghei does not impede blood-stage
      growth. In contrast, mosquito-derived, FabI-deficient P. berghei
      sporozoites are markedly less infective for mice and typically fail to
      complete liver-stage development in vitro. This defect is characterized
      by an inability to form intrahepatic merosomes that normally initiate
      blood-stage infections. These data illuminate key differences between
      liver- and blood-stage parasites in their requirements for host versus de
      novo synthesized fatty acids, and create new prospects for stage-specific
      antimalarial interventions.
