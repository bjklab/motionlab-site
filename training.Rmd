### Knowledge Link

### PennChart  

About PennChart

PennChart Training

PennChart training managed by UPHS 

If you want View Only EPIC access, at a minimum you should take “PennChart View Only” Training: PennChart Clinical View Only (COURSE HS.20001.ITEM.ISEPCVIEWONLY)   

If you want full Research Coordinator Access, you will need to take two courses 

 

PennChart Training for Research Coordinators (COURSE UP.40009.ITEM.HSRWS148) 
PennChart Training for Ambulatory Medical Assistants (MA) and Clinical Research Coordinators (CRC) (COURSE HS.20001.ITEM.PCAMBMA) 
 

This RC access allows for RCs to create notes in PennChart – if you have a clinical trial monitored by Office of Clinical Research, they require RCs to take the longer series. But for chart abstraction, typically the View Only course is sufficient. 

### SAP Concur

Instructor-led demonstration and discussion on Travel & Expense Management at Penn.  Demonstration will include Travel Booking as well as creating and submitting an Expense Report.  Discussion topics will include but are not limited to policy, procedure, and practice for travel booking and expense reimbursement for faculty, staff, and students.
