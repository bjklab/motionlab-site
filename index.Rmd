The MicrobiOme TransmissION (MOTION) laboratory studies the human microbiome to define the mechanisms of bacterial pathogen transfer and colonization resistance, and to develop novel microbiome-based therapeutics (MBTs) that can address the public health threat posed by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Using molecular epidemiology and microbial ecology methods, including metagenomic sequencing, culturomics, and whole-genome sequencing, we define how pathogens move between different hosts, between human hosts and the environment, and how endogenous microbial communities affect this movement. We leverage insights into the mechanisms of bacterial transmission and colonization resistance to design microbial therapeutics that can restore colonization resistance and prevent infection.  
  
Our primary focus is on the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and we serve as the core laboratory for the University of Pennsylvania's Center for the Study of Antibiotic Resistance ([C-STAR](ares.med.upenn.edu)). A second focus is understanding the mechanism -- and improving the efficacy -- of microbial therapeutics like fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) and live biotherapeutic products (LBPs), which depend on microbial transfer for success. We have developed novel Bayesian modeling approaches to trace microbes as they move between human hosts, the environment, and even other host species. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed similar approaches to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics.
